## Writing Guidelines

### Hook (Tweet 1)
- Lead with the most interesting part
- Use numbers ("Cut from 3 hours to 15 minutes")
- Make bold claims you can back up

### Credibility (Tweet 2)
- Show you understand the problem
- Establish authority (users, data, experience)
- Keep it brief (1-2 sentences)

### Value (Tweets 3-5)
- One clear point per tweet
- Use bullets or numbers
- Include specific details
- Add visuals when possible

### CTA (Final tweet)
- Single clear action
- Remove friction ("No credit card")
- Direct link

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Burying the lead:** Don't save the best part for tweet 5
✅ **Hook first:** Best stat/claim goes in tweet 1

❌ **Too much hype:** "Revolutionary game-changer!"
✅ **Specific claims:** "Cut reporting time from 3 hours to 15 minutes"

❌ **Wall of text:** Dense paragraphs
✅ **Whitespace:** Short lines, clear breaks
