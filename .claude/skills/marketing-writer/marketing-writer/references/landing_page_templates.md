# Landing Page Feature Section Templates

Use the **Problem → Solution → Benefit** format for all feature sections.

## Template Structure

```
### [Feature Name]

**The problem:** [What frustrates users? Be specific about the pain point.]

**How we fix it:** [What your feature does, in simple terms.]

**What you get:** [The concrete outcome. Time saved, stress reduced, money earned, etc.]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Automated Reporting Feature

### Stop Building the Same Report Every Week

**The problem:** You spend 3 hours every Friday pulling data from five different tools, copying it into spreadsheets, and formatting charts. It's mind-numbing work that keeps you late.

**How we fix it:** Connect your tools once. We'll pull the data, run the analysis, and generate your report automatically. Every Friday at 9am, it's in your inbox.

**What you get:** Those 3 hours back. Use them for actual strategy work, or just leave on time for once.

### Example 2: Collaboration Features

### End the "Latest Version Final FINAL v3" Nightmare

**The problem:** Someone's always working on the old version. You waste 20 minutes every meeting figuring out who has the latest file and whose edits got lost.

**How we fix it:** Everyone works on the same file. Changes show up instantly. You can see who's editing what. No more version chaos.

**What you get:** Meetings that actually start on time. Zero time spent merging conflicting edits.

## Writing Guidelines

### For the Problem:
- Be specific and detailed
- Use real frustrations users actually have
- Include time wasted or stress caused
- Make it relatable (use "you" language)

### For the Solution:
- Explain the mechanism simply
- Focus on what the user experiences
- Avoid technical jargon
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences max

### For the Benefit:
- Quantify when possible (hours saved, percentage improvement)
- Focus on the emotional or practical outcome
- Make it concrete (not "increased productivity" but "leave at 5pm instead of 7pm")
- End with impact on their life, not just their work

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too vague:** "Streamline your workflow"
✅ **Specific:** "Cut your weekly reporting time from 3 hours to 15 minutes"

❌ **Feature-focused:** "Advanced AI-powered algorithms"
✅ **Benefit-focused:** "Get accurate predictions without hiring a data scientist"

❌ **Marketing speak:** "Transform your productivity paradigm"
✅ **Real talk:** "Stop working late because of busywork"
