Subject: You can now export to Excel with one click

Hey Sarah,

You can now export any report to Excel in one click.

We heard from 200+ users that copying data manually was eating up time. So we built this.

Here's what you get:

• Export any report with one click — no formatting or copying
• All your filters and columns stay intact — what you see is what you get
• Works on mobile too — export from your phone while on the go

Try it now: [Link to feature]

No setup needed. Look for the new export button in any report.

Thanks,
Mike

P.S. Next up: scheduled exports. Want it emailed weekly? Let me know.

## Email Length Guidelines

- Feature announcement: 100-150 words
- Quick update: 75-100 words
- Re-engagement: 100-125 words

When in doubt, cut 30%.

## Subject Line Best Practices

✅ Good:
- "You can now export to PDF"
- "We made imports 10x faster"
- "New: Bulk editing"

❌ Bad:
- "Exciting announcement!" (vague)
- "Newsletter #47" (boring)
- "Check out our latest feature" (no specifics)

## CTA Best Practices

✅ Good:
- "Try it now: [link]"
- "Turn it on: [link]"

❌ Bad:
- "Click here to learn more" (vague)
- "Explore the possibilities" (cringe)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too long:** If it requires scrolling, cut it
✅ **Scannable:** Bullets, short paragraphs

❌ **Vague benefit:** "Improve your workflow"
✅ **Specific benefit:** "Save 3 hours every Friday"

❌ **Multiple CTAs:** Try this, check this, read this
✅ **One clear CTA:** "Try it now: [link]"
