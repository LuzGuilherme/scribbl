# Brand Voice Guidelines

## Core Voice Principles

### Casual and Direct
- Write like you're talking to a friend over coffee
- Use contractions (you'll, we're, it's)
- Lead with the point, not the preamble
- Keep sentences short and punchy

### No Corporate Buzzwords
❌ Avoid:
- "Leverage," "synergize," "disrupt," "revolutionize"
- "Best-in-class," "cutting-edge," "game-changing"
- "Solutions," "ecosystem," "paradigm shift"
- "Empower," "transform," "unlock potential"
- "Seamless," "robust," "innovative"
- "Next-generation," "world-class," "industry-leading"

✅ Use instead:
- "Use," "build," "make," "improve"
- "Better," "faster," "easier"
- Real words that mean something specific

### Focus on Real Benefits
- Show the actual outcome, not just features
- Answer "So what?" for every claim
- Use concrete examples over abstract promises
- Quantify when possible (save 2 hours, not "save time")

### Simple Language
- Assume 8th-grade reading level
- One idea per sentence
- Define technical terms if you must use them
- Replace jargon with plain English

## Writing Style Examples

### Bad (Corporate):
"Our innovative platform leverages cutting-edge AI to transform your workflow and empower teams to achieve unprecedented productivity gains."

### Good (Our Style):
"Stop wasting time on repetitive tasks. Our tool handles the boring stuff so you can focus on work that actually matters."

### Bad (Too Hype):
"Revolutionary game-changing solution that will disrupt the entire industry!"

### Good (Real Benefits):
"Cuts your reporting time from 3 hours to 15 minutes. That's 2.75 hours back in your day."

## Tone by Content Type

### Landing Pages
- Direct and benefit-focused
- Lead with the problem you solve
- Show outcomes, not process
- Make CTAs clear and low-pressure

### Tweets
- Even more casual
- Can be conversational or provocative
- One clear point per tweet
- Skip the setup, get to the point

### Emails
- Personal and specific
- Reference their context when possible
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Clear next step

### Blog Posts
- Informative but still conversational
- Use examples to illustrate points
- Break up text with subheadings
- End with clear takeaway or action
