# SEO Blog Writer Skill

Create blog articles optimized to rank #1 in Google search results by following proven SEO best practices and Google's ranking factors.

## Quick Start Workflow

1. **Analyze the topic** - Identify target keyword and search intent
2. **Research competitors** - Study top-ranking content for the keyword
3. **Plan content structure** - Create outline matching search intent
4. **Write comprehensive content** - Follow E-E-A-T principles
5. **Optimize on-page elements** - Title, meta, headers, URLs
6. **Add internal/external links** - Build topical authority
7. **Final SEO checklist** - Verify all optimization elements

## Core SEO Principles

### Search Intent (Critical - Do First)

Before writing, identify the search intent type:

| Intent Type | User Goal | Content Format |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Informational | Learn something | How-to guides, tutorials, explanations |
| Navigational | Find specific site | Brand pages, product pages |
| Transactional | Buy/take action | Product pages, pricing, signup |
| Commercial | Compare options | Reviews, comparisons, "best of" lists |

**Action:** Search the target keyword in Google, analyze top 5 results to determine what format/angle Google prefers.

### E-E-A-T Framework

Google evaluates content on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness:

**Experience:**
- Include first-hand experience with the topic
- Add personal insights, case studies, original data
- Use specific examples from real usage

**Expertise:**
- Demonstrate deep knowledge of the subject
- Cite reputable sources and studies
- Include author credentials/bio

**Authoritativeness:**
- Build topical authority with comprehensive coverage
- Link to authoritative external sources
- Create content clusters around core topics

**Trustworthiness:**
- Be transparent about sources and methodology
- Include accurate, up-to-date information
- Provide clear contact/about information

For detailed E-E-A-T guidelines, see [references/eeat-guidelines.md](references/eeat-guidelines.md).

## Content Structure Template

### Content Length Guidelines

| Content Type | Word Count | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| Quick answers | 500-800 | Simple informational queries |
| Standard posts | 1,000-1,500 | Moderate competition keywords |

## Keyword Research Guidelines

### Target Keyword Selection Criteria

**Ideal keywords have:**
- Search volume: 100-10,000+ monthly searches
- Keyword difficulty: Under 30 for new sites, under 50 for established sites
- Clear search intent that matches your content
- Commercial value relevant to your goals

### Long-Tail Keyword Strategy

Target long-tail variations (3-5+ words) for:
- Lower competition
- Higher conversion rates
- Clearer search intent
- Voice search optimization

**Example:**

### Keyword Placement Priority

2. Meta description
3. First paragraph (within 100 words)
4. At least one H2 heading
5. Throughout body content naturally
6. Image alt text

### Topic Cluster Model

Build authority through pillar pages and cluster content:

    ├── Cluster Post 2 (specific subtopic)
    ├── Cluster Post 3 (specific subtopic)
    └── Cluster Post 4 (specific subtopic)
```

**Linking rules:**
- Every cluster page links to pillar page

- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")

### Internal Link Best Practices
