## Experience

First-hand experience demonstrates you've actually done/used what you're writing about.

### How to Demonstrate Experience

**Content elements:**
- Personal anecdotes and real examples
- Original photos (not stock images)
- Screenshots of actual usage
- Case studies with real data
- "I tested this" language with specifics
- Lessons learned from doing

**Example - Weak (no experience):**
> "The XYZ software is reported to be user-friendly."

**Example - Strong (demonstrates experience):**
> "After using XYZ software for 6 months on my team's projects, I found the learning curve takes about 2 weeks. The dashboard confused us initially, but the keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+D for duplicate) saved us hours."

### Experience Signals
- Author byline with relevant background
- "About the author" section
- Date of experience mentioned
- Specific details only someone who used it would know
- Process documentation with real examples

### How to Demonstrate Expertise

- Reference peer-reviewed sources

**For practical expertise:**
