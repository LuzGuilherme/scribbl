## Core Principles

### Quality Over Quantity
One high-authority, relevant backlink is worth more than 100 low-quality links.

### Link Quality Factors (Priority Order)
1. **Relevance** - Topically related to your content
2. **Authority** - From high-DA/DR sites
3. **Editorial** - Earned naturally, not paid/exchanged
4. **Placement** - In body content, not footer/sidebar
5. **Anchor text** - Natural, varied
6. **Do-follow** - Passes link equity (no-follow still valuable for traffic)

### What to Avoid
- Paid links (against Google guidelines)
- Link exchanges at scale
- PBNs (Private Blog Networks)
- Low-quality directories
- Comment/forum spam
- Irrelevant links
